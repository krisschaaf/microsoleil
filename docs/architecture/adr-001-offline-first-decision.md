# ADR-001: Architecture Decision - Offline-First Approach

**Date:** 2025-10-27

---

## 1. Context

Modern applications are increasingly expected to remain usable even when the network connection is poor or unavailable. Two architectural paradigms address this challenge: **Offline-First** and **Local-First**.

While they overlap conceptually, their priorities and data models differ in important ways.

---

## 2. Offline-First

**Definition:**  
An **Offline-First** app is designed to function fully without an internet connection, ensuring the user can continue working. When connectivity is restored, local changes are synchronized with a central server.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The **server remains the authoritative source** of truth for data.  
- The **client maintains a local cache** or queue of operations for temporary offline use.  
- **Sync and conflict resolution** are typically handled by the server.  
- Offline support is treated as a **core design constraint**, not an afterthought.

**Common Implementations:**
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with IndexedDB or local caches.  
- Mobile apps using local databases like SQLite or Realm, syncing with an API.  
- Background synchronization through Service Workers or background tasks.

---

## 3. Local-First

**Definition:**  
A **Local-First** app treats the local device as the **primary and authoritative source** of data. Networking and synchronization are optional enhancements, not requirements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Data originates and lives locally** — the cloud is a backup or sharing layer.  
- Users **retain full data ownership and access**, even without any server.  
- **Conflict resolution** often relies on CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) or peer-to-peer merge algorithms.  
- Often designed for **privacy, collaboration, and resilience**.

**Common Implementations:**
- Desktop and personal knowledge tools (e.g., Obsidian, Logseq).  
- Collaborative or peer-to-peer apps using CRDT libraries (e.g., Y.js, Automerge).

## 4. Comparison

| Aspect | Offline-First | Local-First |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Data authority** | Server-authoritative | Client-authoritative |
| **Primary data store** | Server (with local cache) | Local device |
| **Offline behavior** | App continues to function offline, syncs later | App is fully self-contained; sync is optional |
| **Conflict resolution** | Usually server-managed | Often peer-to-peer or CRDT-based |
| **Sync model** | Client ↔ Central Server | Peer-to-peer or client ↔ optional server |
| **Focus** | Reliability and resilience | Ownership, privacy, decentralization |
| **Best suited for** | Apps with shared data or backend dependencies | Personal or collaborative tools without central control |

---

## 5. Decision

We have chosen to adopt an **Offline-First** architecture.

**Reasoning:**
- The application requires a **centralized backend** for shared data and coordination.  
- Future deployments may involve **cloud-hosted environments**, where a consistent server state is necessary.  
- **Offline usability** remains important — users should continue working without interruption — but the **server will remain the ultimate source of truth**.  
- This approach provides the best balance between **user experience (resilient offline mode)** and **operational consistency (centralized data model)**.

**Implications:**
- The client application will use a **local database or cache** to persist offline changes.  
- Synchronization will occur automatically when the device reconnects.  
- The backend API will include **conflict resolution and merge logic** to maintain data integrity.  
- The architecture remains **cloud-ready**, allowing future scaling or migration without changing the data model.

---

## 6. Summary

By adopting an **Offline-First** design, we ensure that:
- Users can work uninterrupted, even without connectivity.  
- The server maintains a single, authoritative data model.  
- The system remains flexible for future cloud deployment and scaling.

This choice balances **user experience**, **technical complexity**, and **operational requirements** effectively for our use case.
